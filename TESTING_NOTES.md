# Projects Module API Testing Summary

This document summarizes the work performed, final status, and outstanding issues related to the API testing for the 'projects' module.

## Work Completed

Significant effort was invested in stabilizing and enhancing the test suite for the `/api/v1/projects` endpoints. Key accomplishments include:

1.  **Authentication Fixed:** Resolved issues with the authentication middleware in the test environment by correctly utilizing the `TEST_JWT_SECRET` environment variable.
2.  **Initial Test Failures Resolved:** Addressed various setup problems that caused initial test failures:
    *   Corrected database configuration for the test environment.
    *   Improved test data setup procedures.
    *   Ensured database migrations are executed correctly as part of the `npm test` script (via `jest.config.js` `globalSetup`).
3.  **Comprehensive Edge Case Testing:** Added numerous tests to cover edge cases, including:
    *   Requests with invalid or non-existent project IDs.
    *   Testing pagination parameters (limit, offset).
    *   Testing filtering and sorting capabilities.
    *   Testing behavior with invalid or expired JWTs.
4.  **Input Validation:** Implemented input validation using `express-validator` within the application routes to ensure data integrity before processing.
5.  **Extensive Debugging:** Investigated and resolved complex issues related to the test environment setup, particularly concerning the migration runner and environment variable propagation.

## Final Status

As of the conclusion of this task, **all API tests for the 'projects' module pass successfully, with the exception of two specific tests.**

*   **Passing Tests:** All tests for `POST`, `GET /`, `GET /:id`, `PUT /:id`, `DELETE /:id` endpoints, including edge cases and validation tests.
*   **Failing Tests:** Two tests targeting the `GET /api/v1/projects/:id/people` endpoint consistently fail.

## Unresolved Issue: `GET /api/v1/projects/:id/people` Tests

The two failing tests for retrieving people associated with a project (`GET /api/v1/projects/:id/people`) consistently produce the following error:

```
SequelizeDatabaseError: column "user_id" does not exist
```

This error indicates that the Sequelize instance used by the application *during the test execution* cannot find the `user_id` column within the `project_assignments` table, despite this column being central to the association between projects and people (users).

**Debugging Steps Attempted (Unsuccessful):**

*   **Verified Migrations:** Confirmed that the migration `20250416132000-create-project-assignments.js` (which defines `user_id`) runs successfully before tests execute via `globalSetup.js`.
*   **Checked Models:** Ensured the `ProjectAssignment` Sequelize model definition correctly includes the `user_id` field and matches the migration schema.
*   **Reviewed Application Code:** Verified that the application route handler for `/projects/:id/people` correctly references `user_id` in its Sequelize queries.
*   **Checked Environment Variables:** Confirmed that all necessary environment variables (database connection, secrets) are correctly loaded in the test environment.
*   **Database Connection Management:** Experimented with different ways of managing database connections within the test lifecycle, suspecting potential stale connection issues.

Despite these efforts, the root cause remains elusive. It is likely related to a complex interaction within the test environment's lifecycle, potentially involving how Sequelize connections are pooled, reused, or how the application instance is initialized relative to the database state during tests.

## Assumptions

*   The database migration file (`20250416132000-create-project-assignments.js`) accurately defines the intended schema for the `project_assignments` table.
*   The `globalSetup.js` script configured in `jest.config.js` is the correct and intended mechanism for running database migrations before the test suite executes.
*   The underlying database (e.g., PostgreSQL) functions correctly and the issue is not with the database server itself.
